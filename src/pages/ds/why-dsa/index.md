Why DSA? 

A question that has been asked very frequently. Especially by people who are developers, and have a hard time remembering algorithms, and thus, miss out on opportunities, because, like it or not, almost every company, every role, expects DSA.

All placement/internship drive rounds start with a coding round, solving a few questions in a limited time. Then comes the tech rounds, which are 'supposed to' be testing the candidate's skills, but which are, these days, largely DSA-only. And this isn't just the case with freshers' roles. Even roles requiring 2-5 years of experience have a major aspect of DSA.

One of my seniors who recently interviewed for a 1.5 year experience role for Facebook had more than 80% of the interviews covered by DSA concepts.

And to think, that there's barely any use of DSA to be used once you're in the role. After all, if you're hiring for a technology X, why do you expect a candidate to know DSA, and then teach her/expect her/him to work on technology X?

Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

It didn't make sense to me, either.
