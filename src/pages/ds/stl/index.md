Disclaimer : You have to be coding DSA in C++ for this post to be of any use to you. If you're not, you can refer to the important data structures used here, and find the corresponding library implementations for them in your language. For instance, HashMap in Java against map in C++, etc.

Disclaimer 2 : This is stuff that I believe to be important, and have used in my journey through DSA. It is by no means all-encompassing or all-covering. This is for those who need a quick refresher/quick reference/quick intro into STL, especially aimed at coding interviews, the season for which is right now.

If you're still here, I'm glad. Let's kick this off.

What the hell is STL?

Standard Template Library. It's a savior for you and me CPP programmers. Thanks to STL, we don't have to code merge sort from scratch in coding interviews which are anyway disastrously short on time. Not only does the library have a lot of functions for many boring things, it has them optimized, so that it'd be faster to implement sort() STL function than code out Quick/Merge sort. It also includes data structures like vectors, pairs, maps, sets, stuff that's gonna make your life easier. 

Why do I need to learn it?

Because you want to crack DSA interviews, because you want to become a good programmer, because you are not a pre-Jurassic guy who codes everything form scratch
