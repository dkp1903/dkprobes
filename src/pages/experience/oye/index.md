I joined Oye Rickshaw as a Software Engineering Intern. Oye Rickshaw is India's largest Electric vehicle company, and focuses on last mile transport, connecting people from their homes to places of public transit.
It's a 4 year old, investor-funded startup.

Tech Stack- Database : Postgres
Backend : Node, Express
Frontend : React
DevOps : GitLab, Docker

I was part of the Energy Services division, working on an interface to allow electric vehicle 'ninjas', the ground force, to update vehicle battery and vendor details, for vehicle drivers to check 
battery status in real time and get updates, on the same.

The architecture was Microservice based, and followed the MVC(Model View Controller) style. 

Through my work so far, I have been able to make live the aforementioned aspects, which have led to higher adoption rates and easier management of drivers, thereby contributing to the company's operational ease.
