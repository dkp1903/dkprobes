Uber is a name as commonplace to ride hailing, as Amazon is to delivery. In fact, Uber calls itself the Amazon of transportation. I didn't make the name, the company executives did.

Uber is huge, there's no doubt about it, and there's no way I am gonna be able to talk everything about it. So, let's stick to some things about Uber that are lesser known, and see if there're some notable points that we can learn from, shall we?

1. Uber isn't a taxi company.

A company, that has drivers with taxi-like-objects that give rides to people all around the city, and you don't call that a taxi company? And you know what? The taxi-like-objects are TAXIS!!

So, if not a taxi company, what the hell does it call it? A car rental? Nada.

Uber calls itself a TECH company.

Those who've come here from the [WeWork](https://dkprobes.tech/Markets/wework) might start throwing eggs at me, saying

> This TECH!! Every damned company calling itself tech just so that little Japanese Yoda would give them a gazillion god-damned dollars!?!?! Why the hell doesn't anybody do anything?

If you're wondering, here's the Japanese Yoda I am talking about:

--masa-son-image

That's Masa Son, the founder of Softbank, who's invested BILLIONS into WeWork, AND Uber, because, well, they called themselves tech companies.

Now, there has to be a logic, right, as to why you'd call a company tech? Uber has nicely prepared its speech for this one.

Uber drivers are partners, and in not-so-nice-terms, 'independent contractors', NOT employees. What's in a name, you might ask, but then, here's a thing about the corporate world : The benefits you get depend on your job title. 



I'll be honest with you. Before writing out this post, I was shit confused. Because the Uber journey is so radically diverse, that I was confused what would be the best part I could describe. So, I went about and asked 10 RANDOM people, what they thought of, when they heard the word 'Uber'.

No surprise, most people came up with 'taxi'.

And the fun part? Uber isn't a taxi company.

In fact, one of the hottest news these days is Uber threatening to pull out of California, and the reason has something to do with this. We'll soon see what.

Uber is gigantic, believe me. When you're thinking global consumer markets, especially in the business that Uber is in, you can make five sections of the largest markets : 

- North America(Mainly USA)

- South America(Mainly Brazil)

- China(ofc)

- India(YESSSS)

- South Asia(Mainly Indonesia)

At one point of time, Uber was the first OR the second place holder in ALL of these markets. And that is saying something. No other company ever, has had that kinda expansion. Not even Google or Facebook, since they're both blocked in China.

It's big. We've established that. So, what does it do? 

Taxi? Oh come on, I just said Uber isn't a taxi company.

Uber, is a Tech company.

(You can throw your eggs at me, especially those who've read the WeWork story)

You have an app that is used to order taxis, and that makes you a tech company?

Uber has been able to defend its claim of being a tech company quite well. And it's been able to do so because of its arrangement with the major stakeholders of the company : the drivers. 

Uber calls its drivers independent, third-party contractors. NOT employees. The cars don't belong to Uber. They belong to drivers, who're independent contractors. This might be thought insignificant, and it was, until quite some time. And the result? Since Uber owned, NEITHER the cars, nor had any 'control' over the drivers, all it did was mediate between drivers and riders, through its technology, and thus, a tech company.

--some iamge here--

This brand of a tech company allowed it to be a part of the tech startup boom in the early 2010s, that helped it receive billions of dollars in funding, evade a number of governmental laws, which'd have not been possible had it called itself a taxi business.

That's not all. By not calling the drivers employees, Uber absolved itself of any compulsion to give the employees any benefits like health, severance, ESOP, that other employees would be entitled to. So, in case there came a situation that'd make the drivers stay home, they'd effectively be unpaid.

Now, what is a situation that is forcing drivers to stay home, these days?

--some image here--

So, now you see what all the ruckus in California is about. When drivers are out of business, Uber has said, "Sorry, can't do anything. You don't work here."



Uber isn't a name uncommon to any part of the world. And they have paid a lot of money for it. In fact, few of us know that Uber has been in the works since 2008, and it's yet to see a profit.

12 years, and it isn't making money.

Before we get on with the Uber story, here's a concept that noobs might have to understand. 
> Concept: When we say a company is LOSING money, it DOES NOT mean it isn't making money. It just means that  
> the company is spending more than it's making. So, whose cash is it that's going down the drain?
> Investors. Angel, VC, your rich uncle, all those people.
> It also doesn't mean that employees aren't getting paid. They are. In fact, employee salaries are a major 
> portion of the company's budget, and thus, restructuring, which is a polite term for kicking people out, 
> is usually a common way to cut down the company's costs.

Why would investors put in the money? They aren't charitable organizations. They're looking for returns. And they get returns when the company starts making profit, and/or goes public. They make big returns. So big that investment is among the highest paid professions in the world. Startup CEOs tell investors why the startup is making losses now, and how it'll achieve the path to profitability.

Kalanick, the Founder of Uber did so, too. He put in 6 points how he thought Uber could be the new thing, and ultimately, rake in a lot of money.

1. Asset light business model, strong network effect, economies of scale and the first mover advantage.

Big words. Ofc, what else can you expect from a 'charismatic founder'

Let's break them

Asset light business model : Uber doesn't own the cars. Uber doesn't have any big assets that could cost it a ton of money. For understanding, compare it to WeWork, which leased buildings on long term and lent them out on short terms. Those buildings were assets, because they were instrumental to WeWork's functioning. What's an office that doesn't have a building!? Uber doesn't have anything like this. It doesn't own the cars. The drivers own the cars. And the drivers, very cleverly are called 'INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS', NOT EMPLOYEES, to distance the assets from the company. So, Uber doesn't have to invest a lot in assets.

Strong network effect : Network effect is when increasing the number of participants improves the service. FOr Uber, more drivers => more passengers => faster service => more users => more drivers and this goes on.

Economies of scale : Easy example - The per capita cost of making a tshirt is cheaper in a large factory, as opposed to a small handloom. As you scale, you improve efficiency through automation, and your per capita costs decrease. For Uber, as number of riders increase, the per capita cost of marketing, customer acquisition, goes down. People satisfied with the good service act as salesmen naturally. 

First mover advantage : The early bird catches the worm. Uber started out in 2008, when the iPhone was just coming through and Android was yet to make a break. This immediate capturing of markets might have helped it gain the lion's share of the market.

2. Prodigious fundraising to Drive competition, establish global monopoly control and pricing power.
I have talked about this in my article [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tradeoff-between-market-share-profit-dushyant-pathak/?trackingId=t%2BqACRYGQDOpveOjqSgNkg%3D%3D) how companies lose money to gain market share, buy out or crush the competition, with the aim to be the sole controller of pricing power. For instance, Jio is almost a monopoly today. It raked on huge debt to onboard 400 MM users, and now, has the power to change prices as it wishes. 

Uber's aim was the same. It used unreal amounts of cash, and went about crushing the competition. This came in the form of offering discounts to customers, offering discounts to drivers to sign up to Uber, away from competitors like Lyft, spending big on marketing, and so on.

3. Advantage of scale; AI used to improve service, shorter wait time for riders, improved driver productivity, which'd lead to low fares and thus, better driver compensation leading the path to corporate profitability.

Whew

Uber grows big. It uses AI to find out how to reduce the time a customer has to wait to get a cab. For instance, it sends a driver nearer to you to pick you up, rather than a driver sitting 100 miles away. It leads to improved driver productivity, as the farther driver doesn't have to travel those 100 miles. Which leads to more driver fares, more money for Uber, and thus, a path to profits.

4. Support of consumers would force government to give Uber the greenlight, in spite of its conflicts with sustainable public transport modes.

This is a very critical point. It shows how Uber KNEW that what it was doing wasn't fully legal and licensed, and for that, it aimed to be so popular among people that the government would have no choice but to allow it.

Why was Uber not legal?

Taxi business is complicated stuff. The govt invests a lot in public transport. In India, you have the BRTS or city buses or metros. In the US, it's the subway and such like. A lot of common people use this, and the government subsidizes these so that it remains affordable for the poor. Now, if there's a company that's threatening to win over the people by offering lower prices to gain the market share, and then being able to control prices, that's not a very good thing, is it?

Moreover, Uber directly competed with taxis, the yellow cabs in the US, auto walas in India. Compete doesn't fully reflect. The yellow cabs were CRUSHED. Ruthlessly. Drivers were either forced to sign up for Uber, or see their livelihood snatched.

Not a very good thing, again, is it?

One more thing, Uber called itself a tech company.

![](./dhum.jpg)

Tech. This word tech. [WeWork](https://dkprobes.tech/Markets/wework) called itself a tech company, for all the wrong reasons. Now, here's another one.

And Uber defended its claim well. Remember, Uber didn't own the cars or the drivers. It used software to connect drivers to riders, and used AI to do the job well. Didn't make it a taxi company. And the goverment couldn't argue with that.

5. Product line extensions would provide profitable growth opportunities to cover up for losses in rides.

Add new products, which will bring in profits, use those profits to stem the losses that Uber rides are making.

![](./well.jpg)

I know. Doesn't make a lot of sense. Instead of trying to make a business profitable, you want to start other businesses, and use those profits to stem the losses you're incurring here. And if you're not hopeful of making profits, why do the business at all?

Turns out, Kalanick had big plans. We'll see eventually.

6. Available funds from capital markets and retained corporate earnings would provide a smooth transition to autonomous vehicles.

Here comes the master blaster. Use VC money until you're private, use shareholders' money when you're public, slowly kick out drivers and replace driver-ed cars with self-driving ones.

The advantage? For an Uber ride, a driver charged around 70% of the fare for herself/himself. Moreover, Uber's service was directly dependent on the drivers' wishes/whims. If there were no drivers, Uber was simply helpless. And it wanted to reduce this total dependence on drivers. And thus, came self-driving cars.

Almost all of the above points hinted at a plan to profitability, making money. Then, why is Uber, after 12 years, still yet to turn a profit?

Let's see some possible reasons : 

1. Undifferentiated service : Cmon, it's taxis. There's not a lot of scope of novelty that you can bring here. For instance, if it were Netflix, you could've brought in more unique content to beat Prime, or better customization for Amazon. In ride hailing, there's little. Uber tried out a few things. It tried partnering with Spotify that'd directly turn on the user's favorite playlist in the ride she/he ordered. Novel idea, but it turns out, people were just bothered with going from point A to point B as fast and as cheap, and no one really cared if they liked the song in the car for a 10 min ride.

The small improvements brought in through AI, reducing wait time, shorter routes, well, it wasn't unique to Uber. Lyft did the same, so did Ola, so did DiDi, so did 99. A great thing's great only if you're the only one doing it.

2. Low customer and driver loyalty : As said in the previous points, customers really didn't care about the color of the car, or the motive of the company, which were the two major factors that separated Uber from its closest competitors. Customers just wanted to get to their destination fast and easy, and they picked whichever service allowed them to do it. 

Same for drivers, they went along whichever company gave them a better cut, sometimes signed up for both, Uber and Lyft(or any other competitor). There was no such thing as customer loyalty.

As opposed to this, brands like Nike have power of customer loyalty. A customer will stick to the brand, because he feels an attachment.

3. Limited Economies of scale : Remember E of S? The t-shirt example from above? Well, it doesn't work all that well with Uber. After all, Uber is not a factory that can increase productivity by increasing the number of machines. Economies of scale are limited only to wherein customers recommend their friends, and drivers recommend their fellow drivers. That's about it, and that's pretty limited too. Remember, Uber loses money per ride. And the lower customer acquisition and marketing costs had only limited success in improving this.

4. Weak Network effects : Network effects would have increased manifold when drivers were jubilant with the money they were making. 

They weren't. Even though Uber was losing money, the drivers weren't loaded with cash either. In order to draw customers, Uber itself took losses, and to partake some of the losses, limited driver cuts. Most drivers toiled 12 hours a day, and still didn't make enough to cross the average household pay. I'm not gonna recommend a service that burns me out without proper remuneration.

5. No recurring revenue/customer lock-in mechanism : Ahhhh, this is my favorite.

Netflix. Yearly subscription. Money's just taken out of your card every month unless you take the pain of cancelling. And the rich people, those who earn thousands a day, don't really bother if Netflix chunks out a meagre 500/- a month. This is called a subscription based model. The customer is 'locked-in', in the sense that once the month starts, the fee is deducted. Nothing you can do about it.

Now think Uber. You don't subscribe for a month of car rides. You just book a ride whenever you want one. And that means, Uber can't snatch away money from your account like Netflix. Money comes only when you actually take a ride. No customer 'lock-in'.

Uber tried 'Uber pass', analogous to passes used in Indian Railways and city buses, but it didn't work. Ride hailing was seen as a disjoint, on-requirement thing, and people didn't really want to commit a month to it. 

6. Intense price competition to attract riders :
