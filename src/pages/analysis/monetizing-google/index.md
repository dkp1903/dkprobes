You gotta admit it; all of us have, at some point in our life, wondered, 

> What would happen if Google Search went paid?

or

> What would happen if Facebook went paid?

If you haven't, God bless your sheltered life. Their numbers are just plain

STAGGERING

There are 70,000 search queries, EVERY SECOND. Take a moment, and just imagine.

That's 42 MILLION searches in a minute. One minute is the time I take to wonder if it's morning or evening, when I wake up. 

Isn't that unreal!?

Facebook is no less.

There are 2.45 BILLION Facebook accounts in the world today. There're around 3.5 Bil social media users around the world. That's just Facebook, the social media site, not the company. Not counting Instagram or WhatsApp, both owned by Facebook.

And you know what the funny part is? To the innocent observer, like I was some 13 years back, making my first Google and Facebook accounts, it's like, these people are doing social service. 

Google Search is free. YouTube is free. Android is free. Chrome is free. GMail is free. Hell, most of it being open source essentially means that as long as you know what you're doing, you can run your own damn version of Android!

Who pays for all the cool Google t-shirts that the employees are seen wearing? Who pays for ACs in the Google offices? Hell, who pays for Google offices? How can they make ANY money, if EVERYTHING is free?!?!?!?!?

As it turns out, everything is not free. 

And that's just one simple word that sums up this situation : Ads.

Had it been 20 years prior, and I'd told you that a company can earn more money through ads, than its competitor company can, by selling its operating system, servers, cloud services and a host of other stuff, COMBINED, you'd have laughed me out of the room.

But, that is exactly the case. Google has more revenue than Microsoft, a company that sells Windows, Office, cloud services(Azure), owns Skype and LinkedIn(both of whose premium services are charged). 

Facebook's even more surprising. A whopping 98.5% of Facebook's revenue comes from ads. If you don't see the sense of it, you're not alone. Senator Orrin Hatch asked the question to Mark Zuckerberg, during the investigation of Facebook by the US government in 2018, as to how could a company that lets people use its platform for free have a sustainable business model? And Zuckerberg smirked and I quote, 

> "Senator, we run ads."

That's all. 

The fact that ads are powerful enough to run some of the largest corporations in the world might be surprising, that is, if you don't understand how these ads work.

When we hear ads, we immediately go to something like this :

This ad had a separate fan base.

But no, while conventional ads are about spreading word out to everyone who'd hear, and hope that some of them buy, ads these days don't quite work like that.

You can pick exactly what age group of people, with what choices and preferences with what income levels, do you want your ad to be shown to, and that's exactly what will happen. This is as good as showing the above Nirma ad to middle class housemakers, which make up their largest market. 

I know, I know, I didn't make my case strongly enough. Let's try again.

Suppose you're looking for a good watch, and by pure magic, you're shown ads of watches that fit your budget, your taste, your style, availability around you, everything.

All you have to do is say yes and get your credit card, and it'll be on your hand before you know it.

And that's the power of the Google Facebook ads. And how do they make sure the ads are SO targeted?

You guessed it.

Data

This 4 letter word has gained SO MUCH traction in the lat 2-3 years that it won't be surprising if parents teach their newborns 'Data' before 'Dada' or 'Mama'.

Data. A whole lot of data. 

Remember how we used to think that Google search was free? 

Here bursts your bubble. You don't pay monetarily, directly, when you search something. But, behind the scenes, Google starts going frantic.

It tracks where you're from, where you work, and by that, your expected salary range, your gender, what stuff you're searching, what time of the day you're searching it, how frequently you're searching it, and a zillion other stuff.

Now think, Google knows when a customer searches what. All it has to do is show the right ad at the right time, and the deal's practically done. And we're not talking pennies here.

Billions of dollars worth of stuff gets sold through these ads.
