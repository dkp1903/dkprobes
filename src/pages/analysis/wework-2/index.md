To those who don't know, Softbank is one of the craziest investment funds in the world. Crazy, yes. Here's a quote from Softbank CEO, Masayoshi Son on his story of investing in Chinese Giant Alibaba : 

> He(Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba) didn't have a business plan. He'd zero revenue. But, his eyes
> were very strong. Strong eyes.

Strong eyes, and he received an investment in billions. Now, that's a whole new level of reading expressions, and when expressions lead to deals that exceed the GDP of many countries, you might wanna wonder what the hell's going on.

Though, not for Softbank. One recurring Masayoshi Son story is how he asks investors, 
> What'd you do if you had twenty times the money you're asking?

He then gives the founder twenty times the money, and asks him to do exactly what the founder had said. For instance, if you say you'd grow grass in space if you'd twenty times the money, Son'll give you twenty times the money and ask you to grow grass in space. And if you can't do it, well, there's pretty much nothing Son can do about it.

> Concept : Venture Capitalists expect huge returns, for the risks they take. For instance, for an average VC, > she invests in 10 firms, out of which only 1 succeeds. That one success should bring her enough return to 
> compensate for the 9 failures, as well as a neat profit.

He's also known for saying, 
> A crazy entrepreneur can beat a smart entrepreneur.

Craziness, eh?

Who are we talking about who'd love to be crazy? The CEO who has a sauna in his office, goes round the world drunk, walks around on streets barefoot. Who else, but our dear Mr Neumann.


2017 -Softbank had just started the largest investment fund of all time, called the Vision fund. A total budget of a 100 Billion dollars.

Right. That's

100000000000 dollars. That's more than the GDP of 130 countries around the world.

Softbank had the money to spend. And it was looking to spend it on crazy tech companies.

Tech

Here comes the tech. Remember how WeWork called itself a TECH company?

Son's strategy is, take a company, and give it so much money, that it can lose money almost endlessly to become a market leader. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tradeoff-between-market-share-profit-dushyant-pathak/) is where I have written about the tradeoff between profits and growth. You might wanna check it out.

Son had been employing the strategy to some success, in some companies like Alibaba, not so much for companies like Uber, that, despite immense funding, was still facing serious competition.

And Son employed this strategy in WeWork. And then told Adam Neumann to go crazy.

Masayoshi Son met with Adam Neumann for 12 minutes.

12 minutes. That's how long I take to decide what YouTube video I want to watch.

12 minutes. Done deal. 

Worth?

US $4.4 Billion. 4.4% of their total fund, given out in 12 minutes. And how?

Masayoshi found Adam Neumann to be the next Jack Ma. The one with the 'eyes'. This time, it was Adam's charisma and craziness that Son felt, would change the world.

Remember crazy?

There you go. You're being paid to go crazy and spend a truckload of cash. 

Why would Son want it? Because he believes in fast growth, and fast growth calls for craziness.

If you want to open 10 offices of WeWork in 10 days, you're gonna need more employees, more logistics, more management, all meaning, more cash. Cash, you have it. You're gonna have to hustle.


Here's where things started going wrong in a real bad way.

Son meant 'crazy' to be a metaphor, for quick growth, buying out the competition, foregoing profits for market share at a speed so fast that any opposition would barely have time to react.

Maybe Neumann didn't understand that 'Crazy' was a metaphor. Here's where I re-quote from my [first post](https://dkprobes.tech/Markets/wework) on WeWork

> Give a CEO more money than he knows what to do with, and he'll spend it writing the company's obituary.

1. Adam's wife, Rebekkah Neumann had a dream one night, wherein she saw that their 5 kids were studying in a school that wasn't conventional, but instead focus on real life skills. She told her husband the next morning, who immediately replied, "Honey, since a school like that doesn't exist, let's take a chunk out of the funding, and make one." They made a school, called WeGrow, an unconventional institution, where Rebekkah had the hopes that children could 
    - Learn farming
    - Learn the way of the world
    - Play

Essentially, everything that normal schools don't do. 

They priced the fees at $42,000/- a year. 

Ladies and gentleman, fees for Harvard are ~ $ 47000. Harvard, one of the best institutes in the world, that has produced a third of the world's top innovation-ists.

Ms Neumann should have taken a course in finance, and the state of the American economy, because clearly, this dream was going too far-fetched.

But believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

2. Neumann loved surfing. Good. He spent company money to go surfing around Central and South America. Not very founder-y, but still, okay.

He spent 32 million dollars to buy a surfing company, under the WeWork brand.

(Utter silence - Too shocked to.....)

![](./shocked.jpg)

Surfing? The thing where you take a board and try to jump on it and balance yourself on the water? Please excuse my ignorance. I'm an inland person, but

WHY THE HELL WOULD AN OFFICE LEASING COMPANY BUY A GODDAMNED SURFING COMPANY?

WeWork's reply?

> They wanted to create artificial waves at their larger corporate projects.

I don't even have a meme that reflects my feelings. And I am still not done.

3. Adam loved smoking pot, but he took it to next level when he smoked pot, WHILE IN THE AIR OVER INTERNATIONAL TERRITORY, en route to Israel, where marijuana is banned, which'd have made him a criminal had he been caught. A CEO of one of the topmost startups in the world, a startup that was emerging as a global leader? A startup that went by the mission 'To elevate the world's consciousness'?

4. The Neumanns, on whims, put out an order BANNING MEAT in ALL of WeWork's offices. So, even if the staple diet of your country is meat, you can't eat it in the WeWork's office. It's fine to smoke pot, yes, not fine to eat meat. And why? Because a founder, sitting thousands of miles away, who's never gonna set foot inside this office, feels so? This is just the ludicrousness of it. The logistics barrier? Going round to every WeWork office, asking each and every employee to never bring a ham sandwich, throwing out all the meat stocks that had been brought in for the office pantries? And all of this load on employees that were already exhausted with the breakneck expansion, and the pressure to show positive returns? It was a s**t show.

> Concept : In any startup, employees take on a salary cut, in exchange for a portion of the company's shares, > called ESOP. This means, that the employees will get money, based on the company's worth. And this means, 
> that they're motivated to hustle big time to notch up their company's worth.

And that's why, WeWork employees silently nursed their wounds and kept going.

At this time, investors might be weeping over the excessive control of the company they wielded over to Neumann, giving in to the dollars swimming before their eyes. But now, the damage was done. Or rather, part of the damage was done.

There was more to come.

More in the next part.
