WeWork. If you haven't heard of it, or what it does, don't worry. I'll make sure you won't forget it ever, after reading this. 

I am en route to be an Analyst by profession, so I deal in cold-hearted logic. And that's that way, I thought, the corporate world worked. You had to show good numbers with plus signs, if you wanted to stay in the game. 

Until, I ran into WeWork.

For those of you who've never heard of it before, WeWork is a startup, once was a so-called unicorn, the face of contemporary startups, which had a golden future. 

> Concept : A unicorn is a startup with a valuation more than one billion dollars. What’s 
> valuation, that’s coming later in the post.

It's business model was simple : Office-leasing. It rented large buildings, gave them a makeover to make them look like modern, affluent workspaces, ones complete with coffee machines, bean bags, couches, and the sort.

It was a great success. WeWork started out in 2010, when the global economy was reeling on the after effects of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, which had kicked down the real estate market to its knees. No major company wanted to buy an office for their employees. And then came in WeWork, like a Messiah, giving you cheap office space with a gazillion lavish amenities. 

Who wouldn't like that!?

Everyone liked that. Investors started falling over themselves to flood WeWork with money. Benchmark Capital, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, some of the biggest names in the investment banking sector, that was trying desperately to get back to its feet.

The first sign of raised eyebrows MIGHT have been, when WeWork started pitching to investors and prospective clients. 

It called itself a TECH company. 

Tech?! Hmm. Remind me what they do again? Rent office space and lease them out, and hope you make a profit. My old grandmother said it was a damned real estate stint. 

And how did WeWork defend its claim?

They said they used Data Analytics to customize customer acquisition and experience.

Okay.

This is how I feel about this.


This is analogous to Amazon calling itself an Automobile company because it rents cars and trucks for delivery. And this apparent extrapolation was not just amusing. It could mean one of these things : 

1. Either the CEO was an idiot and couldn't tell the difference between a tech and a non-tech company

2. They were purposely trying to frame themselves as a tech company. Why they might want to do that is coming along in a minute.

3. It was just a mistake that trickled along.

4. It was a long term vision.

And the funny thing, all four of these reasons might have given analysts reason to not laugh it off.

1. If the CEO can't tell the difference between tech and non-tech, do you want such a person to manage millions of your hard-earned money?

2. This was the time when iPhone and Android were taking over markets, a tech revolution. Investors were plying billions into tech. Being called a tech company helped.......So...let's call our company tech, even if it's not

3. As a face of new age startups, every mistake is a fatal mistake, especially mistakes that put your vision into fog.

4. Long term vision? Why didn't we see that taking shape as WeWork grew?

But

Analysts laughed it off.

WeWork kept gobbling up cash and kept expanding. Had it only been expanding their present model, it wouldn't have been a cause of concern. But, it wasn't.

A famous analyst called DKP once said,
> Give a CEO more money than he knows what to do with, and he'll use it to write the company's 
> obituary.

And Adam Neumann, the CEO of WeWork, was given more money than he knew what to do with.

He started by spending lavishly on WeWork offices, FREE BREAKFASTS at all WeWork offices, every Monday, round the clock free beer for everyone, the best in industry furniture to adorn the offices. 

Now, the investors religiously bent on supporting Neumann claimed, it's all a part of improving customer experience. And I agree, but to a limit.

A new WeWork office soon to be opened realized that the coffee mugs it had ordered wouldn't reach the venue in time for the inauguration. So, what'd they do?

Bought a host of them locally, at 5 times the price.

WeWork changed interior design plans based on whims, rendering barely touched furniture useless. All that money? Poof!

All this can still be accepted, in the name of expansion. What about Neumann spending millions on buying properties for himself? About the sauna he had built RIGHT INTO HIS OFFICE! About his trips all around the globe? 

It came to light somewhere in 2015-16 that MAYBE, Adam realized that they were spending way too much, and he cancelled the free breakfast, laid off a percent of the workers as an attempt to cut costs.

A day later, at an all-hands meeting, he hosted a party, passing free tequila shots around and brought in expensive singers.

Still, WeWork kept burning cash, and growing. 

And grow, it did.

WeWork’s valuation? Goldman Sachs valued it at 60 Billion dollars. JP Morgan took it a step further;

96 Billion dollars.

That’s more than the GDP of around 120 countries.

Here’s the funny thing about valuating a company that’s not public(a company’s NOT public, if it’s shares aren’t available for people like you and me). You’re just making an analytical estimate based on the worth of the assets owned. You can’t say for sure that that’s the money you’re gonna get. You’re just estimating.

Well, well, well.

I’m not done yet. A private company doesn’t release its financials in the open. Meaning, again, vastly simplified, I can cook up any damn number, I can hide away my losses, boost up my profits, and you couldn’t vet that.

The investment banks estimated the valuation based on figures that WeWork(Neumann) CHOSE to give them.

And one last thing. Investment banks aren’t charity organizations. They’re here to make a lot of money. And WeWork being the ‘High-profile‘ company that it was then, investment banks fought brutal to get the contract of being the one to take the company public. And to get that contract, they had to please Neumann.

What makes Neumann happy?

Satisfy his ego. Tell him numbers that he likes, even if it means, well, not being very down-to-earth with the numbers.

How much do you trust the 96 Bil valuation now? A growing ‘Tech‘ company, with huge potential, catches the eyes of one of the largest, most eccentric investment funds in the world.

Enter, Softbank.

That's for part-two.
