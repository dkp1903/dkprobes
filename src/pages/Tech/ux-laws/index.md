Jacob's law - Users spend most of their time on other sites, so they expect your site to work the same way as other sites. 
Websites do better the most standardized the design is.

Law of Common Region - Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they're sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
Common region can be created using a boundary or a background, or both.

Law of Aesthetic - Users perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable. People are more tolerant of minor usability issues
when the design of a product or a service is aesthetically pleasing.
