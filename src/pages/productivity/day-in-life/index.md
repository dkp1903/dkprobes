I am a final year student in Computer Engineering, and I work as a Software Engineering Intern at Crio.Do, an EdTech startup that
creates industry worthy projects for students to learn. I am part of the Content team, so a lot of the content that goes onto the platform and 
into the students' minds, has seen my work.

But, that's only part of the story. I am extremely passionate about technology, and work on numerous side projects, personal hobbies, spend family time and workout regularly.

And while it isn't as rosy as it sounds, I do manage to get some diverse work done. 

In this article, I'd walk through what a typical day at work looks like for me.

Given the pandemic, we're working from home. In fact, I have done 6 internships so far, all of them have been remote :(

I wake up at 7:45 AM in the morning, say a quick prayer thanking God for life and health(No kidding, I do that. Aloud.), complete my chores, and make myself a cup of tea.

Yes, I can't move without tea. It's close to being an addiction, but I am willing to live with it.

As I sip tea, I turn on my machine, and while it takes the few minutes to load up, I revise the events of the past day, and skim over the mails and chats on my phone, so that I don't miss something critical.

As soon as my PC's on, I go to my productivity setup, which includes, at the moment, Notion, Llamalife and Google Calendar. 

Notion is where I keep my todos, databases, and more, Google calendar is to keep track of important meetings and commitments for the day, and Llamalife is a tool I only recently started using, that allows me to time track tasks, something I really really needed.

I jot down and restructure the major tasks for the day, then head over to my daily.dev page to read some new tech articles, or read up on some concept I spent thinking on the previous night.

Around 8:20, I finish this ritual, don my shoes, and set out for a jog. This is one of the most introspective moments of the day. I try to avoid gadgets in the first 15 minutes of my walk, as I think about the stuff
that I am working on, both at Crio, and my personal projects, and see if I can get any new ideas. 

Trust me, I usually do. 

I usually jog around 30 minutes, then head back home, where I work on my core, arms, legs and chest. I use an app called Myworkoutplanner to keep a track of the workout I do.
