Dear Newbie

If you came across posts on LinkedIn about first year student having opened multiple startups, topped academics, become pro at competitive programming, Machine Learning, Full Stack Development and Carpentry, 

TAKE. A. CHILL.

First, not all of it is a big deal - there's a big difference between a 'startup', and 'a random idea that is shared between friends and has a website'. There are 11000 startups created every hour, stats say. How many Clubhouses or Ubers or Zomato-es do we have? Not saying the others are worthless, but it takes lot more than adding a Founder title against your profile on LinkedIn to make an actual startup.

Secondly, if you are lamenting the fact that they can easily manage multiple avenues effortlessly, trying to do everything is the shortest route to disaster. The world needs experts, not jacks of all trades. Focus on your core skill set/tech stack, and do that well. 

Next, if you haven't participated in hackathons, participate in hackathons. I regret only participating in my first one in my third year. No one's going to kill you if all you manage to make is an index.html file. But the learning you'll get in those 24-36 hours far transgresses weeks of 'normal' learning. That's the reason many companies often have hackathon sprints/weeks, where developers, instead of working on their actual day-to-day projects, build something entirely new. A lot of products like Gmail and more have sprung up as Hackathon ideas.

Next, Competitive programming. There's been enough said on the subject already, so I won't rant anymore. Just a summary - yes, CP might help you develop a mindset to ace DSA rounds and tech interviews in tech companies, but your CP rating shouldn't be a mandated indicator. I never had a Codeforces rating above 1500. I still am alive and well here. 

Don't get me wrong - the folks who are celebrating such successes on LinkedIn, they have hustled for it. Good thing. Learn from them. Take inspiration. But DO NOT make it a mandate to follow in the footsteps, or you'll risk burning out before you're out of college. 

After 2 years of being a part of the software world, the one thing that I have consistently realized is that my work life balance and mental health determines my performance. So, 

DON'T. EVER. FORGET. THAT.
