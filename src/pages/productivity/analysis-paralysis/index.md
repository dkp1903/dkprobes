## What is it?

In simpler terms, overthinking. It happens when you think of so many cases, aspects and situations, that you are unable to make a decision.

For instance, while choosing a tech stack for a particular project, you analyze the pros and cons of each, the time to learn the stack, the performance of each, and this analysis keeps going on and on until you just give up doing what you were supposed to do - make the project.

## Why/when does it happen?

Human nature. The higher the stakes of the decision, the higher the chances of analysis paralysis. You keep thinking of issues with every solution you think of, and keep anticipating problems with each solution approach, with the end goal that you're never able to get to deciding.

In other cases, you know you just have the optimal answer - it can be done with just a lil bit more thought, and you keep on for just that 'little bit', but the 'little bit' never comes up to your satisfaction, and you end up giving up on the decision.

## Explain this in context of Software Engineering

Suppose you're starting to work on a new application. Assume you're stupid and choose to use the Waterfall model of development, meaning that all requirements, specs should be drawn up before, and the only release we get is the final product, no feedback cycles, no new releases.

This will mean that you need to ensure that every bit of functionality is captured, all requirements go into the PRD(Product Requirements Document), and all decisions made for the product to go live, since there'll be no possibility of improvement. This means that you keep brainstorming over and over - is Java good enough or should I use Node? Should we use Material UI or Bulma CSS? Should the schema include A details or B details? And you're never really able to make a final decision, until you get fired from your job and/or the role is taken away from you.

## How can we avoid this (in context of Software Engineering)?

Follow the Agile model - wherein there's a constant cycle of feedback and iteration, so that any mistakes, wrong decisions can be accounted for in the next release. Suppose you are unsure of the design, pick one, release it, gather feedback, and based on the feedback, make tweaks to the next release.
