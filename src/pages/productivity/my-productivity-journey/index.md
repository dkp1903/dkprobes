Productivity is a weird thing - almost everyone wants it. But almost everyone wants different things, when they say productivity. For some, checking off a few rough tasks off a sheet or notes app is productive. For others, a carefully planned and scheduled execution and analysis of their day to day obligations is productivity. And like it or not, figuring out what kind of person you are will be make or break when you start your attempt to be productive. 

Let's talk about productivity tools. There's no app that can tell you what kind of person you are in one go - you can either do a trial and error of every tool and every strategy, or can just introspect.

I am dumb, so I did the former, then the latter - first trying through a myriad of todolists, productivity tools, project manager apps to figure out what suited me, and then, after giving up, retrospected on what I really wanted, and what would work best for me. 

It starts with asking yourself a simple question. What category do you relate to, the most : 

1. Are you a person who wants a simple, non intrusive app that you can quickly jot down tasks on, so that you don't forget, and tick them off when you're done?
2. Are you a person who wants to plan your schedule down to the minute, either because you're like Monica from FRIENDS and love planning, or because you're busy enough to have to stick to the schedule, or you're just trying to army-discipline yourself?
3. You're either of 1 or 2, based on your mood of the day.

As you can well expect, I was at 3, and that's one of the dumbest categories you can be in.

So, if you fall into 3, get a hold of your emotions, figure out what WORKS for you, NOT what you LIKE. I realized that all I wanted couldn't fit into a rough todolist. Plus, there's some bit of Monica in me. So I went with 2.

If you're with 1 - believe me, dude, you're lucky. There's a plethora of apps out there. If you need a sync across multiple devices, I'd recommend [Any.Do/Google](http://any.Do/Google) Keep or any similar todolist app. They allow you to jot tasks and check them off when you're done. Any.Do allows you categories to categorize your task into - say, Groceries, ~~wetting~~ making the bed, office work, and so on. The advantage of such an approach is that you're a free bird, and can permit yourself a flexible schedule and can stay away from your devices, so long as you remember to check off the tasks.

I tried this approach at first, during my ~~idiotic~~ formative years. But it didn't quite work for me. Simple reason - not everything I wanted to do was a task. I wanted to make notes to jot down thoughts, have to do lists, manage multiple projects, have deadlines, calendar views to projects and I wanted to look cooler than a todo-list user. So, this approach wasn't for me.

I went to 2.

Oh. Dear. Lord.

It's hell on Earth out here, let me tell you. 12312432513123 apps, each of them claiming to be the 'everything' app, and yet, failing to provide me the one basic necessity - MAKE ME PRODUCTIVE.

I am more than sure I am not the only one who'd faced this above existential crisis when looking at the options available - when there's so much, but almost nothing works.

And like I said in the very first line in this article, this feeling has to do with our interpretations of productivity.

You see, most of these apps are made to encompass a lot of different folks' requirements. Correct that, not even folks. Development teams, marketing teams, individuals, grocery shop owners, you name it. And in this attempt at generalization, these apps have been made so dizzyingly complex, that they fail to do the one thing they're supposed to do - save time, and make us productive.

I was overwhelmed, yes, but not beaten yet. I tried out a few different apps for a week, each. Started with Clickup, this monstrosity of an application that has just one thing - everything. Document databases, calendars, project managers, a zillion integration, agendas, you name it. It was so useful, that it was totally useless for me. No, really - no offence to the great guys at Clickup, who did a heavenly job with the UI and functionality both - but it's just not a tool meant for a single individual who has a few todo+ aspirations. It'd be really useful for larger teams, but wasn't meant for me.

Similarly, I tried Trello - the perfect project-management version of 'Old is Gold'. Trello has been around for way longer than the other project management apps that have picked up steam only recently, and it shows - with an antiquated UI(Again, no offence meant), but lightning fast. It is a Kanban board version of a todolist. But, this didn't work for me on a couple of accounts - 

1. Like I said, all I wanted to use the tool for, wasn't just tasks. And while Trello CAN be used to make notes and stuff, it didn't just feel quite right.
2. Trello's mobile app is rather lousy, and given about 70% of my requirements come up when I am out of touch with my PC, this was a serious hindrance.

Similarly, I tried quite a few other tools - Monday.com(very similar to Clickup), Asana(slightly toned down version of Clickup), and a few others, all with little success.

While this was all quite frustrating, and to some of you, might look like a waste of time(hell, for a moment, it looked like a waste of time to me too), but it made clear a few things in my mind that I wasn't clear with, in the first place.

1. Customization was key - I had requirements that would need customization that no app in the world could possibly provide, and that implied that some compromise would have to be made.
2. Mobile friendliness was a key requirement. As I said, more than 70% of my task scheduling was on mobile - when I was out jogging, while making tea, at the grocer's, and so on.
3. Maybe, 'everything' apps, are not the thing. Maybe, you need more than one tool.

And that,(hopefully) was one of the only things I have ever thought and not regretted thinking about. 

So, I sat down and jotted exactly what I wanted - using pen and paper(pen is a cylindrical stick like thing that releases blue colored fluid that you can make artistic impressions on paper with - this is just in case you've forgotten what pen and paper is - for a few months, I had.)

I needed : 

1. A place where I can write my todos
2. Schedule my day on a calendar(because I couldn't trust myself to get any monotonous stuff done if I didn't follow a strict schedule)
3. Allow reminders
4. Have a good mobile experience
5. Serve as a document database, where I can jot my thoughts(this article was first written in the document database ðŸ™‚)

And then, as luck would have it, the answer literally fell in my lap. 

The very day I was introspecting, I ran into a news headlines, which stated that the guys at Notion had been idiots and forgotten to renew their domain leasing, which meant that the service was down for a few hours. I immediately felt like frat bros with these guys. 

I had heard of Notion, and even looked it over once, but as opposed to some other tools, it was kinda early in the game, and lacked a lot of features, so I had given it up.

But its greatest trump card, no wait, Biden card - it was entirely customizable. It was practically only a modified Google docs with a gazillion templates available - Task boards, calendar views, lists, habit trackers, notes templates- you name it.

While a lot of users feel overwhelmed by Notion, after what I had been through with tools like Clickup, Notion felt like a solitaire game.

Of course, Notion had its limitations - it lacks almost any integration support - it has integrations with Asana, Trello, Evernote - essentially letting you migrate your tasks from these to Notion, but not much help if you weren't using these in the first place. The reminder system was also weird-ish, on Notion.

So, I used good old Google Calendar to schedule my day, then used a Notion Google calendar widget from [indify.co](http://indify.co) to add that Google Calendar as an embed to my Notion page. This is what it looks like


Google calendar, being Google's product, had a pretty incessant scheduling and reminder system, so I relied on it, and it works, for most part.



In terms of Mobile support, working on Notion mobile app is like writing on Google Docs on mobile - it's cluttered and jampacked, but works okay-ish, especially since I didn't really want yet another tool.

Thus, I had it - the not-so-magical trick that would(or would not) help me achieve that blue moon productivity. 

I now use Notion to manage my projects in table/calendar views, add my todolist there, use it for quick notes and writing(I am writing this on Notion, as I had mentioned earlier), and use it to keep track of quite a few things. I use Google calendar for scheduling my day, and then making excuses to not follow the schedule most of the time.ðŸ˜Ž

(Edit - Ten days after I wrote this article, I gave up on strict jampacked Google Calendar schedules. I realized that I had a rough structure in my mind about what needed to be done when, and anything beyond that, I could simply not follow and just ended up being a bunch of notifications jarring to the ear, so I deleted much of them.)

In the coming posts, I'll talk about the productivity strategies I used/tried to use and failed at.
