## What is diversity hiring

Diversity hiring is an attempt to target communities that have systemically been marginalized, and give them incentivized opportunities and resources to A. Improve the workforce diversity, and B. Set a role model for several more people from the community to follow suit.

## Who is it meant for?

This is a questions that's been flying around since a while - improve workforce diversity by organizing hiring drives for particular communities. These communities NEED NOT be limited by gender, sexual orientation or physical disability, although these form the most common bases for most diversity hiring drives.

In India, LGBTQIA+ or race hasn't taken shape of the kinda active moment that it is in the US or Europe. In India, the topic is women - should female candidates, in 2021, be offered the benefit of a special hiring drive.

## What are some examples of diversity hiring processes?

Diversity hiring has been going on for a few years now, but has shot up in prominence as the pandemic has made numerous drives switch fully online. Microsoft has Codess, Walmart has CodeHers, just to name a couple. These drives are conducted alongside, separate from 'normal' hiring drives, and are reserved specifically for women candidates.

## Why is it needed?

The widely touted motivation for this exercise is to increase the workforce diversity in software companies, that continue to be male dominated. The ideal goal is 50-50, but companies have their own milestones for an ideal 'diverse' workforce.

Why do we need a diverse workforce? Well, numerous theories and studies have shown that a diverse workforce, comprising people of various orientations, sexes and beliefs contribute to a much more positive and inclusive atmosphere, and manage to keep an ideological balance and thus make it easier to work at a global scale. Multiple mindsets also foster creativity, which is a definite necessity in a software job.

Whether including women in the workforce leads to an increase in company profits has been studied and questioned, and I'd leave that stone unturned. However, there's no question that having women doesn't reduce/damage team morale or reduce productivity.

Concerns over women having to spend time on maternal engagements, women-specific activities like menstrual cycles are now taken well in stride in most of the larger companies. For instance, introduction of a menstrual leave, not considering maternity when choosing between expected commitment to the role by a male vs a female candidate and so on.

These actions have born fruit, as slowly increasing levels of women in the workforce , alongwith general talks of a conducive atmosphere are increasing.

## Is it too much now?

Amid this optimistic picture - comes the elephant in the room question. Is it time to discontinue the diversity hiring process?

The principal motivation, or rather, complaint behind this school of thought, is the misuse of this 'biased hiring' process by some female candidates who just don't want to work. 

It's been common trend to see that even in 'normal' hiring contests, that is, where gender is not constrained for appearing, female candidates with much lower scores are shortlisted as compared to their male counterparts who miss out. This has made some female aspirants to adopt a lax attitude - they know they can make it despite putting in lesser effort, so why even bother?

Moreover, the primary motives of the diversity hiring contests are often misrepresented. For instance, I had the misfortune of seeing a comment where it was stated that girls should be given special consideration because 'boys cheat in online coding rounds', which was immediately refuted when screenshots surfaced of a telegram group where female candidates shared answers of an ongoing coding contest. Secondly, from the points of views of a lot of students, who have had no actual experience working in a company, women have the same benefits they do - they go to the same college, study the same thing, why give them preferential treatment? Things are already on track, no? Why keep trying to solve a problem after it's been solved?

Finally, there's the argument that reducing difficulty levels for the diversity hiring questions in comparison to normal contests will bring in less technically adept engineers into the workforce, which would reduce workplace productivity. The technical disparity between a student who has gone through DP, Graph and BT questions, vs a student who just had to implement merge sort, are causes of concern, they say.

## Why do companies still continue the diversity hiring processes, in spite of backlash?

But now, on the other hand, is the question why diversity hiring still exists, and in fact, is growing in magnitude. First, companies are far away from meeting ambitious targets they'd set earlier - and there aren't enough female candidates to meet those, so they ramp up the diversity hiring quotas, or at least, keep them steady. Workplaces like Google and M/S, which ostensibly strongly support and implement diversity hiring, still have imbalanced workplace numbers, and many fear that turning off the diversity hiring will set the situation back a decade.

Another problem is that the focus of the drives is misunderstood - most urban center college going students only look at their fellow female batchmates when they think of the proposed target of the hiring drives, which is inaccurate. The focus is also on the girls who do not make it to college, either by social pressure, or lack of a role model. If seeing a female CEO can inspire even 20 women and their parents to make an effort to attend college, it'll be worth it.

## What are some of the major concerns with the process?

Reservation isn't unique to the software industry, as isn't the whole question about reservation - it has its proponents and critics. And just like the larger question of reservation, the solution isn't black and white - no reservation or complete reservation, but rather, a gradual transition into a place where candidates who miss out on opportunities due to the reserved hiring quotas, can be minimized. This has to be done, no doubt about it - if deserving candidates lose out just because they happened to NOT be female, it raises questions on the very problem we're trying to solve - of ensuring merit over biases.

One hurtful problem about this question is the judgement - most girls who do make it to companies are automatically branded as having come in via diversity hiring contests, irrespective of whether or not this was actually the case, and irrespective of the effort they put in. I know female candidates who toiled hard, and came in via the 'normal' hiring drive, only to make it to the company and be branded to have come from another diversity hiring quota - this gets extremely demotivating and depressing for the candidates who've put in long hours to get where they are.

## What is a solution to some of these issues?

My proposed solution : 

Step 1 : Communication and transparency - this is the easiest seeming, but most profound step. A lot of candidates complain that it is only after having given a test, and having seen the results do students find out that the contest had a separate male-female criteria for shortlisting. If the shortlisting criteria is intimated well before the start of the process, the candidates know what to expect, and a lot of hearts can be kept from breaking over unexpected results. 

Secondly, companies should make it super crystal clear in common man's language, why they're focusing on specific groups of people - spit out facts about a lopsided ratio, and the urgent need to recalibrate it. Spit out stats about how they think balancing the ratio will help them achieve their goals of a more productive workplace. One example template is : 

In an attempt to neutralize the workforce disparity at ABCD company, we have decided to focus on so-and-so category of students, by providing them so-and-so relaxation in the hiring process. We have seen that a balanced workforce leads to xy % faster output, and that teams with x diverse category candidates have performed this much better than teams without. We understand that such a policy might reduce chances of some candidates not belonging to so-and-so category to be shortlisted to work with us inspite of having been merit wise more adept, however, we're committed to our ambitious goal of a alphabeta workplace ratio, and we see this process as one of the sole means to match our target. That being said, please be assured that this is a process constantly under iteration, and will be trimmed as and how we inch closer to our goals, so that we can seamlessly transition into a merit-only system.

Step 2 : Avoiding misuse - Not gonna lie, this is easier said than done. History has been witness, that everytime you try to outsmart malpractitioners, they think of new ways to continue the malpractice. We cannot stop it, but we can definitely make it a lot harder to cheat and pass rounds without putting in effort.

Difficulty levels in diversity hiring rounds should be set optimally so that they're not too easy so that candidates without preparation could shoot through those, and also not so hard that the company fails to meet its required number of candidates. Gradually upping the ante to match the difficulty levels of normal hiring challenges can inspire diverse candidates to put in the necessary effort.

There should also be a robust mechanism to punish wrongdoers. If a diverse candidate makes use of illegal sources to help her/them in the coding round, it should be caught, and the candidate barred/penalized for the same - not just for that company, but several others as well. 

Step 3 : Most large companies have dedicated processes for tracking employee diversity numbers, and are expected to report them to several organizations, governmental, and private. If these numbers are made easily accessible to prospective candidates as well, companies have a very strong reference point for claiming why they're hiring who they're hiring. It isn't even some company-private-internal data - it's already public. It just needs some recalibration so that it's shared with the right people.

Step 4 : Finally, the major onus is on us, the aspiring candidates to take this in the right spirit. It may suck if an opportunity you deserved is given to a girl who didn't score as much as you, but that doesn't mean you generalize every girl you find get selected to only have gotten in via this process. Moreover, when you make claims over socials, or form an opinion, stick to facts, and not rhetoric. A lot of stupid reasons floating around were what prompted me to write this piece in the first place - this topic is already way more blown out of proportions than it should've been. Let's tone down the rhetoric, and focus on skills. 

In the same way, girls and other diverse category candidates who do get advantage because of these opportunities should make sure they make full use of these, upskill to match the levels of candidates that have come in via the normal process, if they don't already. Moreover, they should stop engaging in rhetoric about how this process HAS to be done because it's BOYS' fault that they cheat and other superfluous claims. Finally, they should realize that they are role models for girls in villages who'd otherwise never have come to college, and do their best to ensure that they realize this objective.
