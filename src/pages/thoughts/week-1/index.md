I often say

> You're usually planning to fail, and sometimes, you fail that plan and actually succeed

My start to the very ambitious, and very miscalculated 100 days of learning challenge didn't go as planned, but I am only a little sorry about it, because it taught me a really great quality for my personal-development challenge that is often underrated - awareness.

1. Career Development

- Personal
    - Strategized my blog content - DSA, Tech and Markets - some good stuff coming soon :)))
    - DSA : Revised Merge and Quick sorts - super important, I'll say it a million times.
    - System Design - Design of a URL shortening service - kind of a kindergarten problem for the world of System Design
    - Graph theory basics
- Community
    - Created plan for my project for [SLoP](https://slot.dscdaiict.in)
    - Team hustle - Student Government Website, DA-IICT
        - Had a look at AWS and Netlify offerings
        - Learnt a bit of Vue

2. Personal Development

- Recovering from a serious skin infection - irritating and stress-increasing, but can't be helped
- Workout plan
    - Increased daily pushup count to 20
    - Included stretching exercises for arms and abs
    - 2x a day bicep curls
- Health and nutrition
    - Hot lemon water - 1x a day
    - Aloevera - Lemon for hair - improves hair strength
    - Watching greenery for at least 30 mins a day - Relaxes eyes
    - Get up and walk around at least every 45 minutes

3. Personality Development

- Quality I learned
    - Awareness 
        - Addiction is a disease because the addict cannot accept that she/he has the addiction. And this lack of awareness paves way to lack of effort to curb it. 
        - Having a great interest in something, so much so that you get hooked onto it, is but natural. What you have to do is make sure you are aware of the time you're spending on it, and make efforts to pull it down
        - I have been addicted to movies, YouTube, my phone, and a lot of stuff - not always deadly, but rarely good, and I could only begin to get over it, when I accepted that I was edging towards addiction, and that I had to make an effort to cut it.
        - A big mistake is calling an addiction, your 'passion' - If it's a passion, you'll know the limits, they'll just be high. For addiction, it's unreal. Know the difference.

All in all, couldn't complete a lot of goals, but I am glad I could get at least this done, and the fact that I am still enthusiastic about going ahead with the 100 Days of Learning challenge.

Cheers

DKP
