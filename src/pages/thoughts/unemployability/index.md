Unemployability is a root cause of unemployment.

The pandemic, apart from having ravaged most of the economy, has laid bare one truth that most of us fail to realize - you might be employed, but if you're not essential, you'll always have the sword dangling above your head.

If you try to produce electricity by rubbing together stones, you're probably not going to get anywhere. The evolving needs of the world of today need updated training, and our educational system has stubbornly refused to adapt at the same pace.

Rat races from almost infancy now, first to get into premier international schools, than to secure admissions to prestigious IITs/AIIMS, has led the youth of today into an abyss, where they're learning to toil for years, for a job that could be replaced by automation, or another person, or just be done away with, within a heartbeat.

And that's why the world is seeing unemployment at record highs, in spite of much of the economy being back on track - now that companies have realized that the company could work even without all this extra force eating away a chunk of their pay packages, why take them back at all?

That's the point - you're employed, but you're not essential.

Education financing, especially among the economically and socially underprivileged and women, continue to be a huge deterrent to focused upskilling, and therefore, only exacerbates unemployability.

Mass exodus of human capital into areas that are already at saturation has turned employment into a survival of the fittest, and whether or not you're fit is more dependent on your social and economic standing, than on your own talent and hardwork.

You cannot fight a Panzer tank with a bow and arrow, or harness wind energy by rubbing stones - the challenges, requirements and necessities change as we progress, and the tools and techniques to solve them should evolve along side. And this, is simply not happening - by giving us curriculum dating to the 90s and asking us to solve today's problems, we're being given a matchstick and are asked to burn down all of Europe to ashes with it.

An outdated education system is the single largest abhorrent to necessary upskilling. But it isn't the only one.

In the days when we should be calculating computer literacy, we're calculating literacy. 

While India's growth rates had been cause of envy and wonder for many around the world, until at least the mid of the decade, growth was very lopsided and hardly reflective of world trends - the unskilled labor market continues to absorb a majority of the workforce, who'd rather work on low wages here, than have a chance to invest in education and try to enter the skilled labor market. 

Indian population explosion is a sad truth that's so ingrained into us, that most of us have resignedly accepted this as fate. But it needn't be so. Awareness about planned parenthoods and if need be, even stricter measures, if done the right way, can bring down the population growth rate and thus, increase employment ratios.

While India is lucky enough to not see outsourcing by companies, we can't harp this achievement for much longer, if we do not cater to the requirements of the service and industry sectors. 

Thus, there can be no doubt that unemployability gives rise to unemployment, and that it is the collective we - the government, the stakeholders, and the citizens who're responsible for the mess we're in, as well as the opportunity to get out from it.

Invest in education, not in rote learning.

Focus on growing the economy sustainably, not just for numbers in the short term.

Focus on the large scale problems that plague the country's growth - like population, overdependence on manufacturing, and the lack of government program support, rather than refusing their existence.

And then, we can finally solve unemployability, and with it, unemployment.
