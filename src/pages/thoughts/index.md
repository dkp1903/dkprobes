It was 100 days to 2021 on 22nd September 2020, when I decided to kick off a self-inspired self-development challenge called 100 days of learning, focusing on revitalizing myself on three parallels : 

1. Career Development
    - Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Working on my blog(This one :P)
    - Side projects and open source development
    - System Design concepts
    - Open source community projects like [SLoP](https://slop.dscdaiict.in)

2. Personal Development
    - Regular workout findings and improvements
    - Health and nutrition

3. Personality Development
    - Expanding my language vocabulary in English, German and Spanish
    - Focusing on imbibing one new quality a day, and following it through for the next 100 days, until it becomes a lifestyle

Here are my reflections from Week 1 - [Week 1](https://dkprobes.tech/100/week-1)
