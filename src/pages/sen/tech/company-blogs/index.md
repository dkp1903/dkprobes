One of the most underrated resources in the world are tech blogs of some great companies, which are thorough and literally based off the problems and challenges faced by companies in the 'real world', something which most other tutorials/blogs fail to cover. And inspite their detail and depth, they very rarely are jargonised, and thus, make for a very efficient resource for developers seeking to understand how the software industry works.

Here are some of the top blogs I'd recommend you follow for a greater understanding of the problems and solutions in software engineering : 

1. [Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com) - Extremely intuitive posts by Netflix engineers about Data Engineering, Platform Engineering, Architecture, Growth Engineering, Analytics and some of the key business implementations of the streaming giant. If you're a company with 200 million subscribers who stream some of the best quality content round the clock, 365 days a year, you had better be bloody good, and the Netflix team shows how they become bloody good

2. [Uber Engineering](https://eng.uber.com/) - Beneath the seemingly simple UI of the Uber app is a gigantic ecosystem of microservices and applications that cater to thousands of business solutions, right from minimizing driver to rider time, to optimizing routes to improving corresponding processes for its delivery and freight arms, as well as utilizing ML to make predictions about rush hour traffic, Uber does a lot, and their blog covers most of it

3. [Pinterest Engineering](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering) - Pinterest is a company that's not quite often in the news as are Netflix and Uber, but that in no way undercuts the scale and complexity of what they do, and given the rise in popularity of visual content, they have their hands full with scaling and novelty in user experience, and they love writing about it

4. [Airbnb Engineering](https://airbnb.io/) - Airbnb is a pioneer not just in terms of their business idea, but also in terms of the open source contributions they have brought, not a very common thing for startups where tech isn't the core offering. From JavaScript style guides to libraries for React, data engineering projects, their services make you wonder how much time they actually spend doing their house-rent related stuff.

5. [Twitter Engineering](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us) - No one has been more in news than Twitter in the recent months, what with Trump using it as his personal megaphone to spread bullshit until they had enough and kicked him off. But ever thought about the scale at which Twitter operates? How did they ensure that one Trump tweet was sent to his 88 million followers almost simultaneously, and a deleted tweet was also deleted for all 88 million for em, even faster? How did they integrate Revue, a newsletter service they bought, into Twitter? This is the place where they explain it all

Now, a few quick points : 

- No, reading a Netflix blog won't make you ready to interview at Netflix - but it'll teach you a lot about some of the common problems faced, and how they solved it. You can use those techniques in your own projects, even if they're not at Netflix.

- The blogs limit the jargon used, but that doesn't mean newbies are expected to understand everything of it. Remember, most of the blogs are about solving complex business problems at scale - those generally solved by architects with decades of engineering experience. It's okay if you don't understand all they write - just keep upskilling and soon you'll start understanding more and more.

This isn't an exhaustive list, just some of the blogs I know and follow. You can look up some others like 
- [Facebook Engineering](https://engineering.fb.com/), 
- [Blackrock Engineering](https://medium.com/blackrock-engineering), 
- [Quora Engineering](https://quoraengineering.quora.com/), 
- [Logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com)

I'll keep adding more to this list as and when I find them. Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dkp1903) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dkp1903) if there's some blog you think can come up here.
