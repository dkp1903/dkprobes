> No one's born a programmer, ever. People can be born leaders, or singers, or dancers, or even have a penchant for science or maths. But no one ever came with the knowledge of Javascript or the event loop or asynchronicity or threads.

However, those who're born with a strong logic, a willingness to use that logic, a shit load of patience, well, these usually can survive the SD world.

1. Uncertainty - Nothing will go according to plan, almost ever. No bug is willfully introduced, no requirements purposely redrawn. It just happens. But it's your job to expect the unexpected and prepare mentally. The only certainty is uncertainty.
2. Don't take code reviews personally - The review is on your code and on your work. So, change your work and your code. Not your person.
3. Identify patterns - in your work requirements, your teammates' and managers' schedules, your own productive hours. For instance, I noticed in one of my internships that Monday was a day of retrospecting on the progress of the past week, set deadlines for the present week, and that meant there'd be a lot of calls to toughen up and meet deadlines(Personally, I called it 'panic mode'). This enthusiasm(or panic) fizzled out over a couple of days, and I could work in peace without hammers being thrown on me. Identifying this pattern kept me prepared for the onslaught that came on Monday
4. Things that might be 'inconsequential' for you, such as margin-widths, padding, button shapes, might not be inconsequential for your manager or your team. There might be an unnecessarily detailed review on that - that's the case everywhere, so learn to deal with it.
5. Development is only 20% writing code. The rest is planning features, creating sprints, creating architectures, testing, and more. You'll almost NEVER be 'coding all day'
6. Meetings are a necessary evil. There will be a lot of meetings that could've been emails, but every once in a while, one meeting might turn up to actually be radically fruitful. The other meetings are padding for this one meeting.
7. Your work will always expand to occupy the time you give to it - in most cases, you could do the same task in one hour and three. Fix an optimal time, and adhere to it.
8. Impostor syndrome is very real, very common and very unavoidable. There'll be a lot of times when you feel like you are in the wrong place, that development isn't for you, or that you're soon to be brought out and paraded as a person who lied on their resume. That feeling passes once you get things done, so get a grip and get things done.
9. Software Development is a roller coaster ride, only much steeper and more unexpected than any roller coaster on Earth. You'd be on ninth cloud when you're able to solve things, see 'progress', and get fat paychecks. There'll also be times when you blame your job, yourself, be frustrated at irritating bugs. You'll have to live with this uncertainty.
10. Deadlines will almost always be unreal, clients almost always too expectant and teammates almost always not as understanding/supportive as you'd want. Most of the above is only a perspective and will change with time.
11. You're not being paid to type or draw. You're being paid for your brain, and the stuff that comes out of it. That is your biggest asset, so make sure you take mental health very very seriously. Unplug frequently, pursue hobbies, to see a direct effect on your work.
