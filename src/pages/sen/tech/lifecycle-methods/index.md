Lifecycle methods

We see two terms frequently in React land - rendering and mounting, and to newbies, these sort of seem similar. It's supposed to be something about loading the component onto the screen - and that's right, briefly, but what goes behind the scene is slightly different.

Render means to run the render method of the class component, or the entire function logic for a function component, and the component 're-renders' everytime there's a change in the state variables.
