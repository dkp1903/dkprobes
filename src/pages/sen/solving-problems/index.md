Engineering is always about firefighting, or in more sophisticated terms, problem solving. After two years of being 
associated with the industry, I have realized that syntax can always be googled. It's the ability to approach a problem
that differentiates engineers.

This might sound super cliche. Hell, it did sound super cliche to me, because a lot of interviews, tests and exams test
how well you can memorize syntax, rather than how you approach a problem. But once that phase passes, and you're into the industry, no
one's gonna judge you on how well you know syntax - it's about how efficiently and optimally can you analyze a problem, break it down into achievable steps with milestones, 
and drive it to sustainable completion.

During my 5 previous internships, I was fortunate enough in being given problems that couldn't be solved directly with Stack Overflow/Google.
And while it wasn't pretty at times, the frustration and the lack of finding the light in the darkness, it did make me a lot stronger and prone to
approach problems the right way. 

And this experience is exactly what I talk about in this section - what are some of the technical problems I faced, how I approached them, the mistakes I made, the things I learnt, and
how solving them was an excellent experience.
