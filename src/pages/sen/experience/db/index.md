I worked as a Technology Analyst intern at the Credit Risk department of Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank is Germany's largest bank, and one of the leading
investment and corporate banks of the world.

Tech Stack : MongoDB, Node-Express, Angular, Protractor, Karma-Jasmine, TensorflowJS, CI-CD

I worked on the design, development and deployment of a Stock Trading Dashboard application, allowing stock brokers to manage client transaction details, view market prices, news and analyses in real time.

I used stable APIs to fetch stock feed in real time using the Angular HTTPClient Module, parsed the response into Candlestick and Line chart representation, and created provisions to view stock details by entering the stock ticker symbol(Nasdaq)

I also used the same data to run a deep learning model incorporated into the JavaScript logic to train in real time to predict future stock movement allowing the trader to make estimated decisions.

Historic data could be downloaded to identify patterns and make analyses.

Clients can be added, modified and deleted - their transactions are updated via Excel upload, and profits are calculated in real time.

We also have a news page which shows financial news based on category, since newsworthy events lead to stock volatility.

The application was deployed via a CI-CD pipeline constructed through GitHub actions, and end to end tested using Protractor.

The application was a robust MVP for a larger diversification of the department into improving automation to ease stock updates and lead to better customer experience.
