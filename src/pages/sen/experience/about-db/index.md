### How do I pronounce it?

It's D-oi-ch-e bank. The 'ch' as in 'chart', and not like 'shark'. Deutsche is the traditional name of German. Please, it's not douche bank.

### It's a bank. Why does it need software engineers?

It's a bank, yes. Is it a bank like your run-of-the-mill ICICI/SBI banks? Not quite. DB mainly deals with international and corporate clients, aka billionaires, other large companies, and even governments. The stuff it does for these entities require a fair bit of technological input, like ML/AI, Full Stack Dev, Big Data and Automation.

### A brief overview of some of the bank's projects and work structure?

A large trading firm ABC Traders has hired DB to understand why it's trades aren't making profits like they should. The technology team at DB creates a pipeline where they take in all the data about the trades that ABC makes. They process that data using big data and streaming tools like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka to understand trading patterns. Note, this is millions of trades being carried out, so manual oversight isn't possible at all. DB develops algorithms to check for several pain points - at what time do maximum losses occur, what class of stocks gives least RoI? It then creates a small application that'd aid ABC to run a series of checks on the market sentiment before actually making a trade. Thanks to this, ABC's trades start improving.

So, if there's no company like ABC Traders, do they DB engineers sit around playing solitaire? Not quite. Remember, technology only forms 10% of DB's workforce - a majority is financial analysts. DB creates products that'd help these analysts solve, automate and optimize routine tasks. For instance, market research of a particular company can easily be optimized with the aid of technology.

This is a grossly oversimplified view of what technology at DB looks like.

### What is the 'tech stack of DB'?

This is one of the most misrepresented question that can be asked - and the most frequent. DB has 10-15K engineers across almost a thousand teams in 15ish departments. Each team has its own tech stack. Tech stack choices are usually made at a team level based on what technology solves the business problem in the best way. So, there's quite a variety of technologies and languages being used.

Note that this doesn't mean you can use anything under the sun. An overwhelming majority of DB's projects have Angular on the Frontend, Java(Spring) for the backend and Oracle for Database. In Big Data projects, Hadoop, Spark and Kafka are most commonly used. DB partnered with GCP(Google Cloud Platform) in 2020 to optimize their pipelines with the aid of several of GCP's offerings like BigQuery, Compute and so on, so you can find a fair bit of GCP being increasingly adopted across the projects too. Before GCP, RedHat tools were frequently employed in many of the projects. DB also has a few technologies it has created of its own, so these are also commonly used.

Finally, DB also has a number of third party enterprise software tools it uses, based on requirements of each team.

### What is the hiring process for DB?

Note: I am referring to only India Technology hiring. DB doesn't have any major programs for off campus hiring. It mainly visits campuses of IITs, NITs and other colleges across India. There's no segregation of college tiers in case of hiring. It usually hires from CS/IT/EC branches only, but that also depends on the placement processes specific to each college/university.

A. Internships

DB visits campuses to hire interns who have just completed their second year of bachelors and are entering third year. An off the cuff figure at the moment of writing this is 6-7 interns per college are chosen. It usually starts visits around July-August of each year and lasts till November-December. These interns will start their internship approx 5-10 months after they're selected. That is, if you get selected in July/August 2020, you'll start your internship in May 2021. 

In 2021, around 150 interns were hired from colleges across India. In 2020, the number was around 65. Internships are usually done in batches - one batch of interns starts in early May, another batch in early June. This depends on college requirements - some colleges have exams till mid May, so students from those colleges start in June.

B. Placements

DB offers Pre-Placement Offers to some of its interns based on performance during their internships, as well as, at times, a separate interview process. In addition, DB also visits campuses to hire students who have completed 3rd year, and are starting 4th year, for placements.

What is the interview process like?

Round 1 - Coding Round

Round 2, (At times, also a 3) - Technical Interview based on DSA, OOPS, Puzzles

Round 4(Optional) - ProFit round - Discussion of dev and technical knowledge to check if you're a good fit for the company

Round 5 - HR - Standard HR questions

The difficulty level of DB questions is considered slightly lower than those asked by companies like Amazon, Morgan Stanley etc, although it depends on interviewer and college.

### What is the role given to graduates/interns?

Interns - Technology Analyst Intern

Graduates - Graduate Analyst - Technology(Grads in short)

### What is the timeline and structure DB follows for interns with regard to onboarding?

Note : Considering only online internships, which have been the norm for 2 batches now.

Let's say you got an internship around August 2020. By October 2020, the HR team would reach out to you asking for your updated resume.

Around March 2021, there'll be a process called background verification conducted by an external organization, as well as some process from the DB HR team with regard to some benefits you're entitled to. This process involves a lot of form filling and mailing and continues for 1-2 months.

Internship usually starts around the 2nd/3rd week of May, and is expected to continue for 1.5-2 months. Around the last week of the internship, there's a process for evaluating interns for PPOs - this is usually a 3-4 day affair and involves interviews and/or presentations of what you did during your internship. The results of the PPO are intimated directly to the Training and Placement cells of the respective colleges anywhere between 20-50 days after the interviews.

PPO conversion rate ranges roughly from 50-80%, that is, if there are 10 candidates from a particular college, 5-8 of them might get PPOs. Note that this is a rough number based on experience and not something declared by DB, and is subject to change.

### How much of 'finance-y' stuff am I expected to know to do good at DB?

tl; dr : Not much.

Given the largeness of the organization, business requirements are often isolated from the technology team. This means that we don't usually get to delve into finance-y requirements. Rather, some other team translates those requirements into technical requirements for us, and we only cater to those. However, there are numerous cases where it doesn't hurt to have a business sense. However, there's not a lot of prerequisite, and the bank conducts sessions for the grads to understand some of the core business concepts of the bank which are important for general knowledge.

### What 'tech' stuff should I know before joining DB as an "intern"?

Note : Stressing on this again - this is for interns, and is experience based. Not declared by DB.

Interns are divided into teams more or less randomly, so the tech stack you're given will be dependent on the manager and the team. However, it'd be good to have a working knowledge of the following, since these form the basis for almost any project : 

1. HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

2. Some core Java concepts - you should be able to write some basic level Java code

3. You should have a knowledge of SQL and NoSQL DBs - what each of these are and how to write queries for each.

4. Good knowledge of Git

5. Some terminologies like Cloud, Deployment, Build, Testing etc - some googling, youtubing and githubing would do

6. An understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle - mostly covered in a course in most universities - it shows how a product is made - requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment - if you don't have a course on this, search 'software development life cycle'

7. Agile methodology - this is the methodology for project management used by most teams in DB. It involves iterative feature implementation, regular standup calls, retrospectives and so on - again, some googling would give you all you need to know
