I worked as a Software Engineering Intern with the Content Engineering team at Crio.Do.

> Crio is an EdTech startup focused on providing Experiential Learning Content resources to prepare students for the industry.

My role was to analyze user requirements and create industry relevant content and supporting codebases in full stack development.

Some of the major projects I undertook at Crio were as follows : 

1. Codebase creation and overhaul, video content creation for Crio's premium offering - QKart

    QKart is a Flipkart like Ecommerce portal, created using the MERN stack, and is part of Crio's Full Stack Developer Track offering. My job was to improve upon the existing codebase to make it more intuitive for the students, and then create step by step instructional content for the students to follow along. This involved a very deep understanding of the codebase, as well as the core technologies associated with it, and the market dynamics, to ensure that the students were prodded in the right direction.

    [Here is a sample video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YttvVn6Ca2E) of me walking through one of Qkart's NodeJS modules.

2. Creation of an assessment framework to test multiple user repositories' for their APIs' functionality.

    Another major project I had undertaken at Crio was the creation of a testing framework in Python for automated clone, run and testing of the APIs submitted by 6000 users, and generate and store scores for shortlisting users. I used the git-python module, shell scripts and AWS EC2 to accomplish this task.

3. Phase wise content enhancement of Crio's introductory learning content

    I created a pipeline for collection and sorting of, and analysis of feedback on Crio's trial week content on HTTP, REST, Linux, AWS and Git, and making changes to it iteratively based on majority feedback.

    I created an app using Slack, MongoDB Realm and MongoDB Atlas to automatically store slack messages to an Atlas instance. This would allow for Slack message details to be stored in a central repository. I created helper APIs that were then integrated with the Crio internal mentor portal, so that the correct person was assigned responsibility for handling that feedback.
