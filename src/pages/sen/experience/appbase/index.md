I worked briefly with Appbase.io, as a Software Engineering Intern.

Appbase is an early stage startup focused on creating search products and services on top of the ELK stack(Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana).

I was part of the Arc Dashboard team to optimize the search relevancy experience.

Tech Stack : Elasticsearch, React, Redux, Cypress, Node

My job was to identify some of the most pressing bottlenecks in the dashboard that are reducing user retentivity and experience, test them using Cypress, React and Redux, and suggest and implement
optimizations for the same.

Soon after my tenure, Appbase launched its offering on ProductHunt to great fanfare.
