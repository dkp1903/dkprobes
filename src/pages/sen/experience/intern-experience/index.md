Should internships be considered in work experience?

Some context : When hiring for SDE and related roles, companies check on candidates' past work experience, and in most cases, internship experience isn't counted numerically in total experience, although this can be brought up in 1-on-1 interviews based on the interviewer.

However, the largest filtering ever happens based on a robotic, and often automated filtering of applications based on 'Full time work experience', and most companies do not consider internships 'Full time work experience'

The interesting bit? Apart from a few cases like Amazon, who make it explicitly clear that internship experience is NOT to be counted as WE, most other companies are intentionally vague about this, and rely on the number of candidate applications to finalize whether or not they consider internship experience.

Thus, I could theoretically apply at the same company twice, and see different years of experience considered for me, based on candidate pool.

The question - why this confusion and vagueness? Can't every company make it explicit as to whether or not they consider internship experience as full time experience?

The reason this isn't already the norm has to do with what passes for 'internships' in India today. As students' desperation to fill up their resumes grows,  a lot of companies cook up phony 'internships', which are nothing but paid(it is the student who pays) tutoring programs which give out a certificate in the end, claiming that the candidate has completed 'an internship'. In a feeble attempt to make it look legit, some companies come up with referral programs, where students who go through their training program refer other students, and make money off each registration. 

In other cases, when students are hired as interns, often times, the work they're allotted is the sort of work full time employees don't want to waste their time on, mainly rote, monotonous stuff. Or in some cases, in internships in small periods, products made are often Proof-of-Concept, where there is no actual live project experience.

Due to these reasons, companies cannot expect the same level of experience from full time experience holders versus such 'interns'.

On the other hand, there are internships where the student is made to work on live projects, alongside the core team and the full timers, and works as much, if not more, on products that users use.

For instance, in my internships at [Oye Rickshaw](https://dkprobes.tech/experience/oye) and [Crio.Do](http://crio.do/), I was part of the core teams, working on live products, owned responsibility for several features' delivery, and worked as a teammate, more than as an intern.

But, given the former case, most companies are skeptic about this 'internship experience' of mine as well. At least, until they give me a chance to explain what I did during the internship.

Can this be solved? That is totally based on the companies' readiness to invest in recruitment procedures. If they spend enough time to sift through resumes, draw up guidelines for their HR personnel on what could be called an internship, and how much weight could that be given, they could do a decent job of ensuring that candidates with 'good' internship experience aren't penalized because some of the other makeshift internships spoiling the cake.

But I am not at all optimistic about there being community wide guidelines on what sorts of internships to consider, and how much to weigh them. For once, the companies whose so called 'paid training and internship programs' are causing much of the fix we are in, they would raise a big cry, because cmon, their bread and butter comes from them selling their programs for the 'internship certificates'. 

And that, is the story of the confusion on whether or not to consider internships as 'Work Experience'
