Not enough 'attention in the right way', is given to the mental health of those in the Software Engineering industry, most often by non-tech people around us - which may include family, friends, corporate bosses who haven't written code.

After all, to most of 'em, we are folks who only have to 'sit in front of our laptops in AC rooms, typing stuff every now and then'. Hell, anyone could do it - there's nothing laborious about it.

Sadly, even as transparency about Software Engineering has increased manifold over the past 3-4 years, this issue continues to persist.

Memes are often made about some common issues developers face, and while it's pretty good to have a laugh about it every now and then, there's nothing funny when you are under immense pressure trying to figure out a solution to a problem you never knew would arise.

Writing code, and especially debugging is extremely mentally draining. Some claim it's a sport, and that the more you do of it, the better you get. But Tendulkar didn't train 20 hours a day - the process took its time.

I have myself faced very frequent issues with my family - none of whom have a tech background. To them, all I need to do is grab a cuppa, sit at the computer, type away, stare at it, attend a couple meetings, and that's it.

What they don't realize is the thinking that goes unnoticed. We're not paid to be typists - we're paid to be thinkers. And that is as, if not more draining than manual labor. It is, in most cases, extremely focus oriented, and that means that disturbances and distractions very adversely impact the process, and cause anxiety, irritation and high tempers.

After all, what would you be like, if work worth 3 hours of your effort just happened to go up in flames because someone couldn't keep her/his trap shut for once.

So, if there's someone non-techie reading this, please give developers the mental independence and quiet they need, and appreciate the job that they're doing.
