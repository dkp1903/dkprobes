Donald Trump's presidency, his cozying up to dictators like Jong Un and Putin, his authoritarian quelling of the BLM protests, and most significantly, his unceasing tirade of baseless claims of having an election stolen from him was the most prominent, but not the only example of democracy taking a beating, in history.

The US has touted itself as a beacon of democracy, often crushing countries that saw anti-democratic figures rise to power, talk Libya, Iraq, Iran, and thus, a US president breaking what the US upholds as democratic values, and enforces as global standards was hypocritical, and US adversaries like Russia and China spared no expense to mock the US for this.

This, however, overshadowed a growth of anti-democratic, totalitarian regime advances across the globe, with many pro-Trump leaders emboldened by what he and his followers had done - say Turkish President Erdogan, Russian President Putin, Israeli PM Netanyahu, Indian PM Modi, Brazilian President Bolsonaro, Venezuelan dictator Maduro. Several of the left-leaning, pro-democracy European countries like France, Germany, the Nordic, Poland saw the growth of far right political movements which protested against migration, promoted Islamophobia, restricted LGBT rights

And the two worst parts? First, Trump's siege on the democratic election process set a fatal precedent. Cases of election losers around the world who refused to concede and instead, provoked civil disturbance and political crises gave global democracy another gut punch.

And finally, many of these authoritarian rulers shared Trump's policy of downplaying the pandemic, as people faced the brunt of the pandemic as leaders claimed it was going away. And lo and behold, many of these countries shared the same distressing reality that the US did under Trump - COVID was NOT another flu, it was NOT going away, and people were NOT overarching for a break.

Things slowly seem to get back to 'normal', at least in the US, as Biden, a seasoned diplomat, took office and sought to make the pandemic and frayed international relations a priority.

But that was the only good news. In the US itself, Trump's party has been pushing for restricting voting in the name of election security, downplaying the insurrection that nearly killed the American democracy, and using their majorities in states to misrepresent the current Biden administration's goals to kickstart the US economy.

In India, the recently enforced IT act has made it much easier for the government to crack down on dissent, as it has been doing, first with the CAA-NRC implementation in Jan 2020, and the farmers' agitation more recently.

Countries like Hungary and Poland have placed crippling restrictions on progressive human rights like abortion and LGBTQ rights
